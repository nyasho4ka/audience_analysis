# audience_analysis

It is a pet project in the field of data analysis.

The main goal of the project is to analyze the audience of any [Vkontakte](https://vk.com) group

To launch it, you need to follow three main steps:
1. Create a Spotify app to get audio meta data, because Vkontakte has a close and poor audio API
2. Create config.json file according to config.template.json file
3. Launch script with command `python3 main.py --group_id=<group_id>`
